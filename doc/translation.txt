Music NFO Builder: translation
------------------------------


Adapting the program to a different language
--------------------------------------------

Music NFO Builder is designed to take full advantage of the language independence.
All program messages, menus, dialog box, texts etc. are stored
outside of the program in resource files.

To adapt MNB to another language only the *.lng file in directory LANG has
to be translated.
For a native speaker of the language this will take half an hour.
The author would appreciate to get a copy of the translated resource file
for inclusion in the next public release. 

If you make any changes in the existing language files, please let me know.
